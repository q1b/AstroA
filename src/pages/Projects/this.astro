    # ðŸš€ website to moon .
    > I started building this website, but before building this website ?
    1. #### ðŸ¤©  I see websites from other developers
    1. #### ðŸ¤”  Think a lot before applying the design that feels right 
    1. #### ðŸ¤—  Since developer are very friendly, I ask my friend to give me suggestion over my website.

    I used **astro as my base framework** but astro comes with some of cool features like enabling developers to use any framework they like,
    Astro provide ways to prerender components on need .

    # Stack I used 
    1. Astro
    1. Svelte 
    1. Tailwindcss ( CSS-FRAMEWORK )
    1. Supabase
    
    ## Main aim for this website is to make it 
    1. #### Performance
    1. #### User friendly design
    1. #### Fully responsive
    1. #### SEO Friendly
    1. #### Scaleable
    1. #### Proper File structure
    <!-- 1. #### Use least Frameworks  -->
    # Performance 
    ### For performance I had taken some pretty staright forward approach,
    1. #### Make bundle size small, So I used least frameworks like react,vue,svelte or solidjs . Even sometimes I apply the User Effect using these framework but then later, I like to write manually better solution which are 10 times more performat then those frameworks solution but I have to use them if I can't get expected result from my soltution .
    1. #### write optimized code for more performance
    1. #### take help from web animtion api over normal css transition To do complex animations .

    # User friendly design
    1. #### Things that I learned from past helped a lot to design things beautiful
    1. #### Using figma and taking help from other for reviewing my website design
    1. #### The Logo is not a hard work but come out of experimenting with circle in late night .

    # Fully responsive
    1. #### I used tailwindcss as it give a easier solution for writing media query
    1. #### Testing that UI looks great on every device 
    1. #### Used flexbox .

    # SEO Friendly 
    1. #### For this I used robots.txt file learned about it .
    1. #### Learning about how google's search engine work helped a lot .

    # Scalable 
    1. #### I write two portfolio but problem with them is that they become very problematic to use further .
    1. #### I making this portfolio and blog system keeping in mind that I am going to use them for next comming years or atleast months .

    # Structuring my Project Files
    1. #### In this current project There was a time when Whole file system become a mess, I don't know when, but to improve that I redesigned whole project file system And Now I am happy about that .
    ### My project structure

      ```
    Yes! it is powerful ðŸ¦„ for a person who has experience with the framework that he is going to use 
    but still For Example knowing that __svelte framework__ is very good at animating stuff is pretty powerful to use it with other stuff who have to make your website .
    You can use many libraries at the same time in your website from different frameworks, But still use things which you are going to use most of time don't install 
    4 to 5 UI libraries from different frameworks, If you do then you can't use one of them to it's capacity .
    And more libraries will create more confusion So, make a mind map before installing libraries .
