    # Astro ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€ Framework
    > You can use any framework you want (or none at all)
    1. #### ðŸ¤©  Really Awesome Not!
    1. #### ðŸ¤”  But will it not create a mess
    1. #### ðŸ¤—  But still pretty powerfull
    
    Yes! it is powerful ðŸ¦„ for a person who has experience with the framework that he is going to use 
    but still For Example knowing that __svelte framework__ is very good at animating stuff is pretty powerful to use it with other stuff who have to make your website .
    You can use many libraries at the same time in your website from different frameworks, But still use things which you are going to use most of time don't install 
    4 to 5 UI libraries from different frameworks, If you do then you can't use one of them to it's capacity .
    And more libraries will create more confusion So, make a mind map before installing libraries .

    Take a look at frameworks which you are going to use and Where you like to use with Astro .
    In most scenarios One framework is enough or Two framework . 
    > In Comming year there are many tools comming, and already we have a ton of tools So, 
    > The thing that matter is your vesion that how to use them at right place to look and work pretty smooth . 

    > But still these tools are going to make life easier . 
    ## Let's work with an svelte Example

    > In This example I am going to show you how to make a svelte component
    > that will animate underline with [rough-notation](https://roughnotation.com/) 
    > Pure Javascript Library  
    ```html
      <script>
        import { onMount } from 'svelte';
        import { annotate } from 'rough-notation';
        let e;
        onMount(()=>{
          // a for annotation
          const a = annotate( e, {
            type:'underline',
            color: '#FFF',
            rtl:false,
            animate:true,
            padding:10,
            animationDuration:500,
            iterations:2,
          });
          a.show();
        });
      </script>
      <button bind:this={e}>
        <slot/>
      </button>
    ```
    ### Now you can use this component in your Astro file like this 
    ```jsx
    ---
      import MakeItUnderlineAnimate from "./yourSvelteFile.svelte" 
    ---
    <MakeItUnderlineAnimate client:visible >
        iAmUnderlined word
    </MakeItUnderlineAnimate>
    ```
    But still astro is in it's starting stage So, bug are there But to make Astro best by each day you can make issue at there [github repo](https://github.com/snowpackjs/astro/).
